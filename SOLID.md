In object-oriented computer programming, SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable. It is not related to the GRASP software design principles. The principles are a subset of many principles promoted by American software engineer and instructor Robert C. Martin.[1][2][3] Though they apply to any object-oriented design, the SOLID principles can also form a core philosophy for methodologies such as agile development or adaptive software development.[3] The theory of SOLID principles was introduced by Martin in his 2000 paper Design Principles and Design Patterns,[2][4] although the SOLID acronym was introduced later by Michael Feathers.[5]

Concepts
## Single-responsibility principle
    A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.
## Openâ€“closed principle
    "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
## Liskov substitution principle
    "Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program." See also design by contract.
## Interface segregation principle
    "Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."[4]
## Dependency inversion principle
    One should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions.
